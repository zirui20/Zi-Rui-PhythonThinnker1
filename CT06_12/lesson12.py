# Lesson 12 - While Loops

# Recap 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
# Create a program to check if a number is both divisible by 3
# and 5.

# 1. Ask the user to input a number
# 2. Using the '%' operator, check if the number is both a
#    multiple of 3 and 5:
#     If true, print "The number is divisible by 3 and 5!"
# 3. Else, print "The number is not divisible by 3 and 5"

# num = int(input("Give me a number"))

# if num%3 == 0 and num%5 == 0:
#     print("This number is divisible by 3 and 5")
# else:
#     print("This number is not divisible by 3 and 5")



# Task 1: Introduction to while loop
# **Task 1a**:
# Due to a pandemic, the government placed a limit to the number
# of visitors a venue can have.

# Using a 'while' loop, create a program that will increase the
# number of visitors by 1 before printing out the number of
# visitors admitted, until number of visitors reaches 50.

# 1. Create a 'visitors' variable and assign '0' to it
# 2. While there is less than 50 visitors,
#     I. Increase the visitor count by 1
#     II. Print the visitor count

# (For Task 1b & 1c)
# Modify your program to account for the number of visitors
# already present at the venue, and the number of maximum visitors
# allowed for the following:

# **Task 1b**:
# Visitors already present: 18
# Max visitors allowed: 30

# **Task 1c**:
# Visitors already present: 4
# Max visitors allowed: 25

# Visitors = 0
# while Visitors < 50:
#     print(Visitors)
#     Visitors += 1


# Visitors = 18
# while Visitors < 30:
#     print(Visitors)
#     Visitors += 1


# Visitors = 4
# while Visitors < 25:
#     print(Visitors)
#     Visitors += 1



# Task 2: while... break
# A restaurant used to have a max capacity of 50. However, due to
# the worsening of the pandemic, the government has restricted the
# max capacity of the restaurant to 30.

# Using an 'if' condition and 'break' within the 'while' loop,
# modify your answer for Task 1a to terminate the 'while' loop when
# number of visitors is 30.

# Visitors = 0
# while True:
#     if Visitors == 30:
#         break
#     Visitors += 1
#     print(Visitors)


# Task 3: Order taking using while loop
# Using what you have learnt so far, code a program to take a
# customer's order.

# Declare a variable called 'order' and assign an empty string
# variable "" to it.

# Using a 'while' loop:
# 1. Ask the user to enter their order
# 2. For each order entered, concatenate to the 'order' variable.
# 3. Exit the 'while' loop if the user enters "end"
# 4. On program end, print out the customer's order.

# **Bonus**
# 1. Modify your code to remove the comma (",") that appears
#    either at the start or end of your sentence

# order = ""
# while True:
#     user = input("What would you want to order? ")
#     if user == "end":
#         break
#     order = order + user + ","
#     print(order)
# print(order)

# Task 4: while... else
# The else condition will run when the loop exits normally.
# i.e. when the while condition is no longer true.

# Using 'else', create a program that will count from 10 to 1,
# before printing "Happy New Year!"

# **Task 4a**:
# Using a 'while' loop:
# 1. Print the numbers from 10 to 1
# 2. Once count reaches 1, use 'else' to print
#    "Happy New Year!"

# **Task 4b**:
# Now, modify your 'while' loop from Task 4a such that:
# 1. If the number is 5, 'break' out of the loop
# 2. Ensure your code has an 'else'

# Observe that "Happy New Year!" is no longer printed


# num = 10
# while num != 0:
#     print(num)
#     num -= 1
# else:
#     print("Happy new year!")


# Task 5: Math Question
# **Task 5a**:
# Create a program to test the user on their math skills! The
# program will continue generating new questions until the user
# get the wrong answer.

# 1. Using a 'while' loop, 
# 2. Generate 2 random numbers between 1 and 10 (import 'random'
#    and use 'random.randint()')
# 3. Ask the user to add the 2 numbers together in the following
#    format:
#     "What is 3 + 5?"
# 4. If the user gets the correct answer:
#     Print "That's correct!
# 5. Else:
#     print "Wrong! Try again"
#     End the 'while' loop
    
# import random 
  
# num = random.randint(1,10)
# Num = random.randint(1,10)
# answer = num +  Num 


# while True:
#     ui = int(input("What is " + str(num) + "+" +str(Num) + "? "))
#     if ui == answer:
#         print("Thats correct!")
#         break
#     else:
#         print("Thats wrong.")    


# Task 6: Dice Roll till 4
# Using 'while' loop and the 'random.randint()' function from the
# 'random' library, constantly print a random number between 1 and
# 6 until the random number generated is 4.

# 1. Import the 'random' library
# 2. Create 'num' variable and assign it '0'
# 3. While 'num' variable is not '4',
#     a. Using 'random.randint()', assign 'num' variable a random
#        number between 1 and 6.
#     b. Print the random number generated.

# **Bonus**
# Some ideas to improve on the above program:
# 1. Add a counter variable and announce the number of tries it
#    took before rolling a '4'.
# 2. Add the ability for the user to determine which number to roll
#    until (instead of '4' all the time).
# 3. Break out of the 'while' loop if counter variable reaches 10
#    and print "You have won the jackpot!"

import random 
    
Num = 4 

while True:
    num = (random.randint(1,6))
    if num == Num:
        print("4")
        break
    else:
        print(num)
